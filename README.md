 Git can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company because it allows people to collaboratively work on a coding related project at their own speed and time almost seamlessly utilizing a variety of commands like adding, commiting, and pushing.  The following document will define Git terms as well as Vi terms.
 
 # Devon Keen's Work (Linux Terms)
 
 1. cd - a Linux command used to change the current working directory in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. To use, type "cd (insert name of directory)".

2. mkdir - a Linux command that allows the user to create directories (also referred to as folders in some operating systems ). This command can create multiple directories at once as well as set the permissions for the directories. To use, type "mkdir (insert name of directory here)". 

3. cp - a Linux command used to copy files or group of files or directory. It creates an exact image of a file on a disk with different file name. cp command requires at least two filenames in its arguments. To use, type "cp (file 1) (file 2)".

4. pwd - a Linux command line utility for printing the current working directory. It will print the full system path of the current working directory to standard output. By default the pwd command ignores symlinks, although the full physical path of a current directory can be shown with an option. To use, type "pwd".

5. mv - a Linux command line utility that moves files or directories from one place to another. It supports moving single files, multiple files and directories. It can prompt before overwriting and has an option to only move files that are new than the destination. To use, type "mv (old file) (new file)".

6. rm - a Linux command that stands for remove here. rm command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links and so on from the file system like UNIX. To use, type "rm (file)".

7. history - a Linux command that keeps a list of all the other commands that have been run from that terminal session, then allows you to replay or reuse those commands instead of retyping them. To use, type "history".

8. Home directory and ~ - a home directory, also called a login directory, is the directory on Unix-like operating systems that serves as the repository for a user's personal files, directories and programs. The ~ symbol stands for a "tilde" to denote a user's home directory. Thus tilde slash (~/) is the beginning of a path to a file or directory below the user's home directory. ... Note: Quite often, the succeeding file or directory name is preceded by a period (".") which indicates that it is hidden (in Linux).

9. file paths in linux - A file path is the human-readable representation of a file or folder’s location on a computer system. Ex: /home/seth/Pictures/penguin.jpg . Can be found by typing "pwd" where you want to know the file path.

10. Using the tab key to complete file paths - this is a way to complete a file path without typing it out entirely. To use, start typing the file path, then press tab, and if you typed it correctly so far, it finishes it for you.

11. Using up and down arrow for history - this is a way to access previous commands typed in a terminal using the up and down arrow keys. To use, press the up arrow key after previously entering in commands to navigate previous commands.  To go back, press the down arrow key to return to newer commands you typed.
